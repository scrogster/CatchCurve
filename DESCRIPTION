Package: CatchCurve
Title: R functions for estimating survival rates from age-structure samples
Description: Includes some established methods, such as the Chapman-Robson estimator. A method for 
	catch-curve estimation with covariates, based on the geometric probability distribution is 		included. This allows estimation of survival rates for composite age-structure samples,
	conditional on site or individual specific covariates, such as sex, population, species, genotype 		or similar.
