Package: CatchCurve
Title: R functions for estimating survival rates from age-structure samples
Description: Includes an established method for catch curve analysis, (the Chapman-Robson
    estimator). A (possibly novel?) method for catch-curve estimation with covariates, 
    based on linear models with geometric probability distribution is also included.
    The method allows estimation of survival rates for composite age-structure
    samples, conditional on population or individual specific covariates, such
    as sex, population, species, genotype or similar. In effect, the model is a
    generalized linear model, with geometric error structure, and logit link
    function. Model selection using corrected AIC is supported.
